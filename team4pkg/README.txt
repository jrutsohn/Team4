This package contains the code for Team 4's final project of BIOS 735.  The goal of the study was to determine which features best predict whether a client opens a term deposit within a Portuguese bank.  The Bank Marketing Data Set from UC-Irvine's machine learning repository was used (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) for this project.  The data set originated from a study by Moro, Cortez, and Rita (2014) whose purpose was similar to this project. 

This package contains stand-alone code for optimizing the logistic regression function used for prediction [i.e. the Module 2 portion] as well as the tests, documentation, etc.  An additional folder was created--projectcode--that shows how to replicate the results found in the report and presentation.  This folder is not necessary to run any of the code for the package or to perform Module 2.  This code is provided simply to allow replication for the imputation, LR, and SVM sections of the presentation and paper.

The only necessities to replicating the presentation and paper are the data: bank-additional-full.csv and imputedData.csv.  Technically, imputedData.csv can be created using the code in all_impute.R.  However, this is time consuming, so the actual data were provided in the GitHub repository.

There are no necessities for Module 2 to work outside of following the parameter specifications presented in the function documentation, and other data have been used to test the logistic regression function.
